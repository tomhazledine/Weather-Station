# Weather Station

A repo for storing my (very basic) attempts to connect some real-world sensors to the internet.

## Current objectives:

* Read Sense Hat data from a Raspberry Pi (using Python).
* Trigger that Python script from a Node app.
* Create a Node server/API that will return data in JSON format.
* Built traditional HTML web page to display the data.
* Use D3.js to display the data in a more visually interesting manner.
